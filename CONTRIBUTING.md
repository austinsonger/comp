# Contributing to Comp AI

Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

## House rules

- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/trycompai/comp/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/trycompai/comp/pulls).
- GitHub issues: take note of the `ðŸš¨ needs approval` label.
  - **For Contributors**:
    - Feature Requests: Wait for a core member to approve and remove the `ðŸš¨ needs approval` label before you start coding or submit a PR.
    - Bugs, Security, Performance, Documentation, etc.: You can start coding immediately, even if the `ðŸš¨ needs approval` label is present. This label mainly concerns feature requests.
  - **Our Process**:
    - Issues from non-core members automatically receive the `ðŸš¨ needs approval` label.
    - We greatly value new feature ideas. To ensure consistency in the product's direction, they undergo review and approval.

## Developing

The development branch is `dev`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. We will merge into main every week.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/trycompai/comp/fork/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

3. Install bun:

   https://bun.sh/docs/installation

4. Install the dependencies with:

   ```sh
   bun i
   ```

5. Set up your `.env` file:

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `SECRET_KEY` in the `.env` file.
   
   - Setup Trigger.dev
     - CD into apps/app and run `bunx trigger.dev@latest login`, then `bunx trigger.dev@latest dev`
     - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` in the `.env` file.

6. Start developing and watch for code changes:

   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```
