When editing translations, only modify the [en.ts](mdc:apps/app/src/locales/en.ts) file.

Other files are automatically generated based on the values in en.ts


Whenever you are instructed to fix translations, you should look up [en.ts](mdc:apps/app/src/locales/en.ts) to see if a relevant translation already exists, and only create one if not. You should try to be DRY and not duplicate strings.


Example of using Translations:
`t("vendors.tasks.title")`

Never pass in a second argument, that is not the issue if you see a linter problem. The problem is missing key. Just look at en.ts to debug. 

Always follow the syntax as in `t("vendors.tasks.title")`

This corresponds to the key of the object inside [en.ts](mdc:apps/app/src/locales/en.ts) 
If there is a linting error, likely this key doesn't exist in [en.ts](mdc:apps/app/src/locales/en.ts) yet.


Also never add translations directly in en.ts, check the files it links to, it should always be in a subfile.
