In the database schemas (prisma .schema files) we always want to use custom ID's using `generate_prefixed_cuid` such as

model User {
 id          String @id @default(dbgenerated("generate_prefixed_cuid('ctl'::text)"))
}

Rules
- Params must include ::text
- Function calls must be within dbgenerated()

This will generate a user readable ID such as `usr_BJRIZLgRPuWt8MvMjkSY82f1u3580YSW` 

We should aim for short but unique prefixes, usually 2-3 characters.
