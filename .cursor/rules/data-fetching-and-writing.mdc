We use the following conversions for data:

For reading data:
- Always try to fetch data from a server side rendered component (at Next.js page or server component level)
- Only resort to client side fetching if there is a strong reason why server component fetching wouldn't work.
- Refer to [page.tsx](mdc:apps/app/src/app/[locale]/(app)/(dashboard)/[orgId]/tests/all/[testId]/page.tsx) for an example.
- Avoid using cache, if you encounter a cache usage, remove it. We will reintroduce this later in an intentional way.


For writing data:
- We use server actions, refer to [create-new-policy.ts](mdc:apps/app/src/actions/policies/create-new-policy.ts) for an example.
